## Biography

I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Statistics at Reed College. 

My research interests are in small area estimation, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, environmental statistics applied to forestry and natural resources problems, and statistical software development. More specifically, my research focuses on implementing model-based statistical methods for small area estimation of forest attributes, and developing methodologies for formal assessment of those estimators. 

I have a passion for teaching data science and statistics, and for mentoring undergraduate students on research projects. I have had the great pleasure of co-directing and mentoring students in the Undergraduate Forestry Data Science Lab during summers at Harvard University and at Bucknell University. Further, I wholeheartedly believe in the benefits and impact of statistical software for teaching, learning, and research. I've developed `R` packages [for teaching statistics](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gglm), [as a result of research with undergraduates](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=saeczi) and [for implementing methodological research](https://github.com/graysonwhite/kbaabb/). I also maintain an `R` package with my collaborators from the U.S. Forest Service, [`FIESTA`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FIESTA), which is used for both internally and externally for forest inventory estimation projects and research.
