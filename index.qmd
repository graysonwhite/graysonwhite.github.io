## Biography

I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Statistics at Reed College. I am completing my dissertation as a doctoral student in the [Finley Lab](https://www.finley-lab.com) at Michigan State University (expected 2026). My research interests are in small area estimation, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, applications of statistical methods to forestry and natural resources problems, and statistical software development. 

I have a passion for teaching data science and statistics, and for mentoring undergraduate students on research projects. I have had the great pleasure of co-directing and mentoring students in the Undergraduate Forestry Data Science Lab at Harvard University (Summer 2022, Summer 2023) and at Bucknell University (Summer 2025). I developed the `R` package [`gglm`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gglm) in order to allow statistics and data science educators to introduce linear model diagnostic plots while staying within tidyverse-syntax and using `ggplot2`. 

I believe strongly in extending the reach and impact of research projects via statistical software. Many of my research projects include `R` packages that implement the introduced methodology, such as [`saeczi`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=saeczi) and [`kbaabb`](https://github.com/graysonwhite/kbaabb/).
