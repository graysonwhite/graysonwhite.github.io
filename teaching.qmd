As an educator I aim to create an inclusive, safe, welcoming, and productive space for students to engage deeply with statistics and data science concepts. I strive to help students gain confidence in their mathematical, statistical, and programmatic skills by making my courses feel accessible and welcoming, genuinely engaging with questions and feedback from students, and adapting my practices based on continued experience in the classroom.
