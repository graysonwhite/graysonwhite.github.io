      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently a senior at Reed College and am wrapping up a year long thesis investigating the benefits of hierarchical Bayesian modeling for small area estimation, in particular with an application to forestry data. Currently, I am working as a Course Assistant and independent tutor for Math 241: Data Science, and an independent tutor for Math 392: Mathematical Statistics. Last fall, I worked as a Course Assistant for Math 141: Introduction to Probability &amp;amp; Statistics, and an independent tutor for Econ 311: Survey of Econometric Methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I worked as a Data Science for Public Good researcher at Oregon State University. I worked with Dr. Christine Kelly to develop forecasting tools for cost analysis of water and wastewater facilities in Oregon small towns and cities in order to provide city planners with data driven solutions for planning long term development and financial investments. You can see a technical report and dashboard below on my website in the &amp;ldquo;Posts&amp;rdquo; sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have experience working as a Statistics Tutor and Course Assistant at Reed College. While working as a group tutor I held weekly study sessions for Math 141: Introduction to Probability and Statistics. I provided students with the help needed to answer questions regarding probability and statistics along with questions regarding programming in R. As mentioned above, I also work as an individual tutor for many statistics courses, and as a Course Assistant holding regular office hours.&lt;/p&gt;
