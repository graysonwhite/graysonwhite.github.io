    "text": "I’m Grayson, a Visiting Assistant Professor of Statistics at Reed College and a doctoral student in the Finley Lab at Michigan State University working on a Ph.D. in Forestry. Prior to attending Michigan State, I worked as a Data Scientist contracting with the USDA Forest Service where I primarily worked on the development and public release of the FIESTA R package. Prior to that, I received a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics with a concentration in statistics at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.\nMy research interests are in small area estimation, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, applications of statistical methods to forestry and natural resources problems, teaching data science and statistics, and statistical software development. A list of my publications and other scholarly activity is available here. I also enjoy writing, maintaining, and contributing to statistical software. A few of my favorite pieces of statistical software that I have worked on are FIESTA (co-author, maintainer), for estimation and analysis of forest inventory data, and gglm (author, maintainer), for easily making diagnostic plots for linear models using ggplot2.\nOutside of research I enjoy exploring new places with my dog, Dude, camping, cycling, and trying my best to perfect my home espresso skills and technique."

I strive to help students gain confidence in their mathematical, statistical, and programmatic skills by making my courses feel accessible and welcoming, genuinely engaging with questions and feedback from students, and adapting my practices based on continued experience in the classroom.\nAt Reed College, I will be teaching Math 141: Introduction to Probability and Statistics in Fall 2025 and Math 241: Data Science in Spring 2026.\nAt Michigan State University, I was the Instructor for Forestry 128: Practical Computing and Data Science Tools in Fall 2024. My course website is available here: for128.org. I also was a Teaching Assistant for Forestry 128 and Forestry 372: Ecological Monitoring and Data Analysis.\nPrior to my time at Michigan State University, I was a Data Science Educator at Posit. I was also a Course Assistant and Tutor during my time as an undergraduate at Reed College, assisting in courses such as Math 141: Introduction to Probability and Statistics, Math 241: Data Science, Math 392: Mathematical Statistics, and Econ 311: Survey of Econometric Methods."

I developed the R package gglm in order to allow statistics and data science educators to introduce linear model diagnostic plots while staying within tidyverse-syntax and using ggplot2.\nI believe strongly in extending the reach and impact of research projects via statistical software.
