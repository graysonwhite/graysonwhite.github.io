    "text": "Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, I was immersed in nature from an early age. In turn, outside of being a statistics, data science, and forestry educator and researcher, many of my passions relate to spending time outdoors. Some of my hobbies include exploring new places with my dog (“Dude”, pictured below), cycling, camping, and trying my best to perfect my home espresso skills and technique."

    "text": "My research interests lie in small area estimation, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, survey statistics, statistical software, and computing. I am broadly interested in statistical problems motivated by applications to forestry and forest inventory and in answering authentically-motivated research questions from the USDA Forest Service. Central themes in my research include developing novel estimation methods for environmental data and developing simulation-based techniques for the formal evaluation of statistical estimators. I strive to increase practical impact of my research via the development of statistical software such as R packages and interactive dashboards."
