    "text": "Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, I was immersed in nature from an early age. In turn, outside of being a statistics, data science, and forestry educator and researcher, many of my passions relate to spending time outdoors. Some of my hobbies include exploring new places with my dog (“Dude”, pictured below), cycling, camping, and trying my best to perfect my home espresso skills and technique."

    "text": "My research interests lie in small area estimation, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, survey statistics, statistical software, and computing. I am broadly interested in statistical problems motivated by applications to forestry and forest inventory and in answering authentically-motivated research questions from the USDA Forest Service. Central themes in my research include developing novel estimation methods for environmental data and developing simulation-based techniques for the formal evaluation of statistical estimators. I strive to increase practical impact of my research via the development of statistical software such as R packages and interactive dashboards."

Generally, my research interests are in small area estimation, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, applications of statistical methods to forestry and natural resources problems, and statistical software development. More specifically, my research focuses on implementing model-based statistical methods for small area estimation of forest attributes, and developing methodologies for formal assessment of those estimators.\nI have a passion for teaching data science and statistics, and for mentoring undergraduate students on research projects. I have had the great pleasure of co-directing and mentoring students in the Undergraduate Forestry Data Science Lab during summers at Harvard University and at Bucknell University.\nI passionately believe in the benefits of statistical software for teaching, learning, and research. I developed the R package gglm in order to allow statistics and data science educators to introduce linear model diagnostic plots while staying within tidyverse-syntax and using ggplot2. Further, in order to extend the reach and impact of my research projects, I have developed R packages the implement the introduced methodology, such as saeczi and kbaabb.
