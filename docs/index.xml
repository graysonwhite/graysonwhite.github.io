      <title>Small Area Estimates for National Applications: A Database to Dashboard Strategy Using FIESTA
</title>

      <description>Abstract This paper demonstrates a process for translating a database of forest measurements to interactive dashboards through which users can access statistically defensible estimates and analyses anywhere in the conterminous US. It taps the extensive Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plot network along with national remotely sensed data layers to produce estimates using widely accepted model-assisted and small area estimation methodologies. It leverages a decade‚Äôs worth of statistical and computational research on FIA‚Äôs flexible estimation engine, FIESTA, and provides a vehicle through which scientists and analysts can share their own tools and analytical processes.</description>

      <description>Overview The R package, FIESTA (Forest Inventory ESTimation and Analysis) is a research estimation tool for analysts that work with sample-based inventory data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program. FIESTA can generate FIA‚Äôs traditional state-wide estimates while also accommodate: unique population boundaries, different evaluation time periods, customized stratification schemes, non-standard variance equations, integration of multi-scale remotely-sensed data and other auxiliary information, and interaction with other modeling and estimation tools from CRAN‚Äôs library of packages.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian Small Area Estimation Using Weakly Informative Priors in Ecologically Homogeneous Areas of the Interior Western Forests

      <description>Abstract The U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) collects inventory data on and computes estimates for many forest attributes to monitor the status and trends of the nation&amp;rsquo;s forests. Increasingly, FIA needs to produce estimates in small geographic and temporal regions. In this application, we implement area level hierarchical Bayesian (HB) small area estimators of several forest attributes for ecosubsections in the Interior West of the US. We use a remotely-sensed auxiliary variable, percent tree canopy cover, to predict response variables derived from ground-collected data such as basal area, biomass, tree count, and volume.</description>

      <description>Overview gglm, The Grammar of Graphics for Linear Model Diagnostics, is an R package and official ggplot2 extension that creates beautiful ggplot2 diagnostic plots for linear models that are easy to use and adhere to The Grammar of Graphics. The purpose of this package is to provide a sensible alternative to using the base-R plot() function to produce diagnostic plots for linear models.
Access gglm is available on CRAN and on GitHub.</description>

      <description>Thank you to all the folks who have contributed both technical and creative skills to this project:
Desir√©e De Leon ü¶í (designed 5 of the custom color themes, made illustrations for the workshop, and provided general aesthetic feedback along the way)
Garrick Aden-Buie üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (debugged headroom.js and lent his panelset.js code to the theme)
Allison Horst üêï (awesome illustrations of campfires, seedlings, and evergreens, as well as my R Markdown hedgehog mascot ü¶î)</description>
