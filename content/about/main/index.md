  I'm Grayson, a a doctoral student (Statistics & Forestry) in the [Finley Lab](https://finley-lab.com/) at Michigan State University. Prior to attending Michigan State, I worked as a Data Scientist contracting with the USDA Forest Service where I primarily worked on the development and public release of the [*FIESTA* R package](https://github.com/USDAForestService/FIESTA). Prior to that, I received a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics with a concentration in statistics at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.
  
  My research interests are in small area estimation, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, applications of statistics to forestry, and statistical software development. A list of my publications are available [here](/publications). I also enjoy writing, maintaining, and contributing to statistical software. A few of my favorite pieces of statistical software that I have worked on are [*FIESTA*](https://github.com/USDAForestService/FIESTA) (co-author, maintainer), for estimation and analysis of forest inventory data, and [*gglm*](https://github.com/graysonwhite/gglm) (author, maintainer), for easily making diagnostic plots for linear models using *ggplot2*. 
  
  Outside of research I enjoy exploring new places with my dog, Dude, camping, cycling, and trying my best to perfect my home espresso skills and technique.
