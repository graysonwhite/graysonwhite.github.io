### Overview

The R package, `FIESTA` (Forest Inventory ESTimation and Analysis) is a
research estimation tool for analysts that work with sample-based
inventory data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service,
Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program. `FIESTA` can generate FIA’s
traditional state-wide estimates while also accommodate: unique
population boundaries, different evaluation time periods, customized
stratification schemes, non-standard variance equations, integration of
multi-scale remotely-sensed data and other auxiliary information, and
interaction with other modeling and estimation tools from CRAN’s library
of packages. `FIESTA` contains a collection of functions that can access
FIA databases, summarize and compile plot and spatial data, and generate
estimates with associated sampling errors.

### Access

`FIESTA` is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FIESTA) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/USDAForestService/FIESTA). To learn more and read
`FIESTA`'s vignettes, see the [GitHub Pages site](https://usdaforestservice.github.io/FIESTA/).
