### Overview

`gglm`, The Grammar of Graphics for Linear Model
Diagnostics, is an R package and [official `ggplot2`
extension](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/) that creates
beautiful `ggplot2` diagnostic plots for linear models that are easy to
use and adhere to The Grammar of Graphics. The purpose of this package
is to provide a sensible alternative to using the base-R `plot()`
function to produce diagnostic plots for linear models.

### Access

`gglm` is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gglm) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/graysonwhite/gglm). To learn more about `gglm`, see
