  [preprint]: Small area estimation of forest biomass via a two-stage model for continuous zero-inflated data
---

### Abstract

The U.S. Forest Inventory & Analysis Program (FIA) collects data on and monitors the trends of forests in the United States. FIA is increasingly interested in monitoring forest attributes such as biomass at fine geographic and temporal scales, resulting in a need for assessment and development of small area estimation techniques applied to forest inventory contexts. We implement a small area estimator and parametric bootstrap estimator that account for zero-inflation in biomass data via a two-stage model-based approach. We compare the performance of this estimator to the post-stratified estimator and to the unit and area-level empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP) estimators. We conduct a simulation study with counties in Nevada, U.S. based on actual sampled plot data and remote sensing data products. Results show that the zero-inflation estimator has the lowest relative bias and the smallest empirical root mean square error. Moreover, the 95% confidence interval coverages of the zero-inflation estimator and the unit-level EBLUP are more accurate than the other two estimators. To further illustrate the practical utility, we employ a data application across the 2019 measurement year in Nevada. We introduce the R package, saeczi, which efficiently implements the zero-inflation estimator and its mean square error estimator.
