  FIESTA: A forest inventory estimation and analysis R package
---

### Abstract

Ecologists are increasingly relying on national forest inventories to address a wide
variety of issues. The ‘FIESTA’ R package (Forest Inventory ESTimation and Analysis) is a
tool that enables customized investigations using the extensive sample-based inventory
data collected across all lands in the US by the US Dept of Agriculture, Forest Service,
Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program. To date, the complex nature of the FIA
inventory constrains many users to conduct only limited analyses through existing
tools with pre-specified geographic boundaries, timeframes, and auxiliary data under
a single statistical estimation process. Yet, the rapid evolution of available remotely
sensed data and statistical methods present the opportunity to conduct spatial and
temporal analyses of forest attributes that are much more relevant to many pressing
ecological, environmental, economic, and social issues in the US, The ‘FIESTA’ package
was developed to augment the current set of available tools by providing a flexible
platform that accommodates evolving technologies and leading-edge estimation 
techniques. The package contains a collection of functions that can query FIA databases,
summarize sample-based inventory data, extract and aggregate auxiliary spatial data,
and generate estimates with associated variances. The ‘FIESTA’ R package is available
on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=FIESTA).
