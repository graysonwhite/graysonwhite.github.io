title: "About me"
---


Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, I was immersed in nature from an early age. In turn, outside of being a statistics, data science, and forestry educator and researcher, many of my passions relate to spending time outdoors. Some of my hobbies include exploring new places with my dog ("Dude", pictured below), cycling, camping, and trying my best to perfect my home espresso skills and technique.
